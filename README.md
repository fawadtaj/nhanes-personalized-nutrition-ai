# AI-based Personalized Nutrition Analysis (NHANES 2017–2018)

This project demonstrates how machine learning and statistical modeling
can be applied to large-scale nutritional datasets (NHANES 2017–2018)
to uncover relationships between diet composition and metabolic health.

## Objectives
- Predict fasting glucose from macronutrient intake and BMI.
- Identify dietary-metabolic subgroups ("metabotypes") using clustering.
- Explore interpretable AI for personalized dietary insights.

## Data Source
Publicly available NHANES 2017–2018 datasets from the U.S. CDC:
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/

## Key Techniques
- Linear regression (StatsModels)
- Random Forest (scikit-learn)
- SHAP interpretability
- K-Means clustering for metabotypes

## Results
- Carbohydrate intake and BMI were strongest glucose predictors.
- Identified three distinct metabolic phenotypes based on diet patterns.
